# Image_Classifier_With_Deep-Learning
## Background: 
Image classifier is a machine learning project I am currently doing for the Deep Learning lesson in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Its main objective is to deploy a deep learning model using PyTorch that is trained on hundreds of thousands of flower images to predict and classify flower images.  
## Content: 
This project is mainly done on Jupyter Notebook and done in Python. The Python libraries used were Numpy, PyTorch, PIL, and Matplotlib.
